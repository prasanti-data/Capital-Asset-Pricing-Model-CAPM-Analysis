# Capital-Asset-Pricing-Model-CAPM-Analysis
A hands-on project exploring the theory and application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to calculate expected returns and beta for individual securities and a portfolio of stocks.

## üìñ Overview

This project demonstrates the intuition behind CAPM and how beta quantifies systematic risk. Using Python, we scale, normalize, and visualize stock data, calculate daily returns, and apply the CAPM formula to estimate expected returns for individual securities and an entire portfolio.

2. Import libraries and datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Scale and normalize financial data  
4. Perform interactive data visualization  
5. Develop a function to calculate daily returns  
6. Calculate Beta for individual securities  
7. Apply the CAPM formula to individual securities  
8. Calculate Beta for all stocks in the portfolio

## üìä Key Insights

- Beta measures a security‚Äôs sensitivity to market movements and quantifies systematic risk  
- Expected returns can be estimated using the CAPM formula:  
  \[
  E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f)
  \]  
- Interactive visualizations help identify trends and correlations in stock performance  
- Scaling and normalization improve accuracy in financial analysis and comparisons
